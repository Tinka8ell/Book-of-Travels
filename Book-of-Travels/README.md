Generate maps for the Book of Travels TMORPG

## Gatherring maps
As I travelled arounf the game I took screen shots of the in-game maps for each location I found.
I then made a spreadsheet to relate each location to a map name and for each known exit,
a key, an offset on the image (x,y) and where (if anywhere) it went to as a map id and key.

## Code
There are three main parts:
* Generating look ups to convert names to keys etc
* Generating structure of "location objects
* Generating html files from templates to display each location and link to each other

## The result so far
I have loaded the output on [my local web server](http://tinkabell.ddns.net/bot/braidedshore.html) where it can be viewed.
